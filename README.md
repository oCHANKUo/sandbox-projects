# sandbox-projects
A collection of small coding challenges, made for personal practice and fun. A diary of fun small projects

1. 6.24.2025 - Created the repo. I previously made individual repos for small projects such as Game of Life, Fractal trees and Langtons Ant, that seems wasteful. Gonna                add everything to this.
2. 6.25.2025 - Programmed the Brian's Brain cellular automata. Its very badly optimized. Tried optimising it with the help of ChatGPT, but i dont think its a success. Planning on adding a button to run it each time
